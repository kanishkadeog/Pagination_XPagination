# XPagination - React Paginated List Application

## 📘 Overview

**XPagination** is a React-based frontend application designed to demonstrate **pagination logic**, **dynamic data rendering**, and **user-friendly navigation** using class or functional components. It allows users to navigate through a list of items using previous/next buttons and page numbers.

This project was built as part of a frontend skill test to showcase clean UI state management, reusability of components, and handling edge cases like first/last page limits.
